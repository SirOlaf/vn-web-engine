# `emotedriver.dll`

TypeScript implementation of the E-mote Direct3D runtime, for build SHA-256
`a3b693b605d67812e489b1fb62cd341012b5514fc9114a032fee4685e70b3a86` (NEKOPARA Vol. 1).
It provides `contract.ts` and is registered with the loader by `library.ts`. Native
addresses in comments refer to that build.

## Layout

| `player.ts`              | `PEmotePlayer` (0x1007174c)             | slot facade over the player core                   |

| `runtime/controls/`      | `emote::EP*`                            | eye, eyebrow, mouth, selector, loop, wind, physics |
| `runtime/mesh/`          | 0x1002cd90, 0x1002d960, 0x1003f680      | vertex kernel (Wasm crate `wasm/emote-mesh`)       |
| `runtime/render/`        | `MMotionRenderer`, `MMotionDevice`      | draw list, textures, D3D9 calls                    |

Models come from `src/formats/kirikiri/emote-model.ts`; the player keeps the typed
model in place of the native PSB views. Drawing goes through the `d3d9.dll` contract
(`src/native/d3d9/contract.ts`) on the device the compositor passes to `emoteCreate`,
so state the compositor sets is visible to the runtime and restored after `render`,
as on Direct3D 9.

## Numeric conventions

The native code stores single-precision floats and computes in x87 registers.
Evaluation keeps values that the native code stores as `float` rounded with
`Math.fround` at the same points, so tests can compare against values derived from the
native algorithm.

## Tests

`tests/emotedriver-*.test.mjs` drive the runtime through the contract on synthetic
models (`tests/kirikiri-psb-fixtures.mjs`) and compare variables, node state and vertex
output at fixed times. Rendering tests record D3D9 calls on a recording device.
